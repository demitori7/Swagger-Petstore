# Test task
## It was necessary to create a collection in Postman based on the Swagger collection. 
### It was necessary to work with queries:
### 1.Create a new pet (method POST/pet). Need to write a script that extracts the ID of the created pet from the response body and writes it to the environment.
### 2.Request a pet by id(method GET/pet) using a previously recorded environment variable in the request. Need to write a script that will take the body of the response, change the "status" parameter to "sold" (sold) and redirect it to a pet change request (PUT/pet method)
